        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Adrian Salinas and I'm 24 years old. I'm a full-time student at Lewis University, pursuing a degree in Computer Science.
            I've always been fascinated by computers and new technologies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I offered technical support services to help
